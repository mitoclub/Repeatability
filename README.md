# Repeatability
We introduce, estimate, and analyze changes in repeatability — a property of each SNP that quantifies its effect on increasing or decreasing the abundance of direct repeats overlapping the DNA sequence at that position. This property can be biologically relevant for processes such as deletion formation and other DNA alterations.
